I think using Git, Github, and GitHub desktop together could help people whether they are using it for work, school, or personal, to use this anywhere and collaborate and communicate without having to text or email about it. Git is exteremley helpful in the tool of collaboration because sometimes working on a public repository, two people acnnot be on it at the same time. This assignment helped me visualize what the cloud storage of GuitHub Desktop does, and then being able to publish this as a repsoitory (public or private).
